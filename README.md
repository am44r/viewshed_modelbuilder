# viewshed_modelbuilder

📖 Overview
This project is a Geographic Information Processing assignment for GGR321. The objective is to conduct Viewshed Analysis to determine the best sightseeing location on a mountain and perform a Least Cost Path Analysis to design an optimal hiking trail connecting the urban area to the sightseeing spot.

🎯 Objectives
Conduct Viewshed Analysis to determine which candidate location provides the best visibility of the urban area.
Perform Least Cost Path Analysis to design a hiking trail considering elevation and land cover.
Use Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Land Use data for spatial analysis.
🗺️ Data Used
The dataset is stored in a File Geodatabase (Data\Data.gdb) and includes:

Candidate Spots:
CandidateSpot_A
CandidateSpot_B
CandidateSpot_C
LandUse: Urban and other land cover types.
DEM (Digital Elevation Model): Elevation data of the region.
